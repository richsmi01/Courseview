/*first, we should check to see if the user has any cohorts...if they don't, return without doing anything else.
 * Also, certain pages are beyond our ability to automatically filter out.  For instance, we do want the cvaddtocohorttreeview to
 * pop up when desiging a poll.  However, we don't want it to pop up when taking the poll.  The only way to do this is to look for
 * a particular word in the $action string that is created by the plugin.  Again, for the poll plugin, this $action String looks something
 * like this: http://localhost/elgg/action/polls/vote  -- In this case we are able to pull out the word vote as being unique to this page and check 
 * for it.  If we find it, we don't want to add cvaddtocohorttreeview to the page.
 * 
 * Note - For now, I've just hard-coded the 'vote' but what I really should do is eventually add a text input to the settings form that will allow
 * the user to type in a set of keywords, separated by spaces, and use them instead of a hardcoded 'vote'.  
 * 
 * Further Note - I should add the ability for my cv_debug to switch to certain modes from the settings form.  For instance, a series of checkboxes  of 
 * all possible logging activities.  One could be 'Show Actions' which the administrator could select and have all actions added to the log file. 
 *  That way the administrator could look for filter words.

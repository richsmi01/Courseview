Oct 2 Agenda - Hey Matt...sorry but I'm not as prepared as I should be...caught a touch of the flu over the 
weekend and I'm just starting to feel better...

Anyway, I thought we could discuss the following:

- Is there any way that you are comfortable with that would let you view my screen remotely?  I know that Chrome has a couple plugins but 
I want to be sure that you're ok with the security aspects of doing this.  If you are, it would make things much easier as I could show you the code 
that I'm having trouble with, I could run it, you could see the results and make suggestions.

-  I've been sketching out what I think the app should look like since I was too sick to make it over to the computer...I just transferred
my thoughts to a ppt which I'll send you and walk you through to see if you have any comments or suggestions.

-  I have a little chunk of code in testinginit (under pages) that I would like to discuss with you...I have a lot of quesions.
    --what is the best way to add metadata?  is it set? set_meta_data, or simply adding a field?

- I'd like to know how I could add a link to the group edit page after intercepting that page with my elgg_register_event_handler('pagesetup', 'system','interceptpagesetup'); in 
the start.php file.

Thanks eh!
Rich.

Sept 26 Agenda:

-  Walk through start and content pane and get feedback about how I'm doing things
-  Talk about how I should use views more advantageously and don't just use elgg_echo everywhere
-  Have him walk me through how he would find out more about this group add function stuff
-  Have him walk me through how he would find out more about elgg_get_entity_by...
-  Discuss hosting a test elgg site for reporting to athabasca profs

Stuff for Rich to do next week

-  work through Matt's css tutorial plugin and fix up the course menu
- figure out the whole building the course tree into a group object thing
- fix up how I'm using views so I use less ad-hoq elgg_echo's through the code.
